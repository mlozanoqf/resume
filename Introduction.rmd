## `r fontawesome::fa("chalkboard-teacher")` Distance and face-to-face learning.

The content of this syllabus applies to any learning format, including face-to-face, blended or fully distance learning. 

Distance learning is an educational method in which students are not physically present on school premises. In my experience, distance learning courses can be just as good as traditional in-person learning. Students may have their preferences, but I believe you (as students) should be able to learn under a wide variety of changing circumstances. In fact, recruiters often seek applicants who can demonstrate adaptability to unfamiliar environments and respond positively to unexpected changes and new ways of working. So, do not be afraid of online courses or distance learning schemes. If you approach them with a positive mindset, not only you can learn a lot, but you can also develop valuable skills that are increasingly sought after in the job market.

The first distance learning course I taught was in September 1999, and I have been into distance learning since then as a postgraduate student and professor. My growing research network consists of colleagues in Chile, Ireland, UK, Italy and Spain. Even though we physically meet about once a year, most of the time we work remotely and we are quite used to it. It is important to know how to collaborate in virtual environments just as well as we do in face-to-face formats, including the available technology that allows us to shorten physical distance between us. 

I have vast experience with face-to-face, blended and distance learning in all its variants, and I hope this experience can contribute to help you complete this course successfully. Welcome again!

<!-- This is my teaching philosophy in 100 words: *The time and the brain are resources and constraints as both restrict the amount of time available to learn. We understand this at the university, so we use these resources efficiently. Here, we stimulate our mental capacity to create and innovate by doing research; and we teach how to think and learn in a systematic and scientific manner. Here, we promote the most fundamental human values to build a prosperous society. I love teaching almost as much as doing research because every semester represents a new opportunity to further enhance our lives by learning the most given our time constraints.* -->

I have a passion for art, particularly painting and music, as they embody the expression of human creativity and imagination. During my free time, I enjoy playing my Yamaha digital piano. I have also been actively involved in music as a keyboardist, piano player, and orchestra director. I have gained extensive experience in this field through performances at live concerts in Mexico and Europe, including piano solo concerts and musicals organized by the Tecnológico de Monterrey (Campus Monterrey) for approximately a decade.
